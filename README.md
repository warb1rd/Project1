Planet Mars has become one of the most coveted resource-planet in the entire milky way galaxy. Invaders from beyond have identified the planet and want to plunder its rare metals. You must defend your new home planet of Mars against the ruthless invaders.

#### Playing the game
---

This is a two person game:
The invaders will move towards your planet and you need to hit them with all your fire power. The more area you hit, the faster they retreat.

You will be rewarded with some rare metals if you score more than the other defender. 

* Move your space craft left to right using the  **arrow keys**.
* Fire photon torpedos using **spacebar**.
* Destroy invaders before they get too close to the planet's orbit.

#### Technology used
---
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Photoshop CS6

The entire game was written in HTML and designed with CSS and animated in JavaScript using jQuery.

#### Game architecture
---
I used old school notebook and pens to illustrate my game design from start to finish. My working process:


I broke the game into enemy and friendly and added features for each category. 

ie. Enemy needs to move left, right and down. Defending space craft needs to fire photons at the enemy and be able to move left, right on player key downs etc

I kept the code extremely simple and used only concepts known to me and those that I could figure out easily using the great big internet.

#### User experience
---
This game is designed to be played quickly. Each player takes less than 5 min to complete. As a player, that keeps my attention.

---
#### Dream Works
Plans are:  

* To make the aliens fire at the players. 
* To finish the game with each row of aliens worth different points. 
* Exploding aliens
* Add sounds.
* To add new levels where aliens speed up more. 
* Add different ships for different players and levels.
