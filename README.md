Planet Mars has become one of the most coveted resource-planet in the entire milky way galaxy. Invaders from beyond have identified the planet and want to plunder its rare metals. You must defend your new home planet of Mars against the ruthless invaders.

####Playing the game

This is a two person game:
The invaders will move towards your planet and you need to hit them with all your fire power. The more area you hit, the faster they retreat.

However, you will be rewarded with some rare metals if you score more than the other defender. 

* Move your space craft left to right using the  **arrow keys**.

* Fire photon torpedos using **spacebar**.
